My first repository - learning about GitHub
Hello!

My name is Thomas Barton.  I am a novice programmer, with some object-oriented experience from my BS in Information Technology from West Point.  I served in the Army for 8 years (7 years Active Duty, 1 year Individual Ready Reserve), and have been away from programming and the Technology industry for that time.  I am looking to rekindle my passion for programming and re-familiarize myself with writing and developing programs.
